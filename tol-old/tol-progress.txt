-currently working on the XtalSpire prism & tapering cap union
 the cap is currently on the bottom due to translation issues presumably due to
 not forming it and translating around the origin at onset, also the base size
 has some sizing issues (about double the size, not sure where taper ends due
 to it currently being inside of the 'base' of the prism
-created a standalone testing file for this object
