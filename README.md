I first started working on the Qabbalistic Tree of Life (Sephiroth) in
POVRay rendering software several years ago.  It didn't take me too long
to complete (this was a three dimensional vision that I had on my own,
though I've seen different spatially oriented versions that hadn't
immediately occurred to me), but the code was nasty, and too many things
were hardcoded.  A second pass through it gave me something better to
work with, but in the needs of full modularization, scaling
requirements, and importability into full, animated, scenes, I need to
finish the job.  That's what this is.  Stay tuned for moar.
